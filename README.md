# Statistical Metamorphic Testing (MT) of Neural Network Based Intrusion Detection Systems

This paper proposes a statistical based MT technique to unveil implementation bugs in NN based N-IDSs, especially, in an environment where neither the random seeds nor the weights can be fixed in order to get deterministic results.  This repository contains classifiers' original code, mutants generated, excel files (containing predictions) and their processed versions, the C# utility, and the results produced.

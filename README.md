# Statistical Metamorphic Testing (MT) of Neural Network Based Intrusion Detection Systems

Testing computationally complex neural network-based applications (i.e. network intrusion detection systems) is a challenging task due to the absence of a test oracle. Metamorphic testing is a method to potentially solve the oracle problem when the correctness of individual output is difficult to determine. However, due to the stochastic nature of these applications, multiple runs with the same input can produce slightly different results; thus rendering traditional metamorphic testing technique inadequate. To address this problem, this paper proposes a statistical metamorphic testing technique to test neural network based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (N-IDSs) in a non-deterministic environment. We also performed mutation analysis to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed method has a strong defect detection capability and is able to kill 100\% implementation bugs in two neural network-based N-IDSs, and 66.66\% in a neural network-based cancer prediction system.
